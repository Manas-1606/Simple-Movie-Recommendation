# Simple-Movie-Recommendation
This repository contains the source code for a simple movie recommendation
This is done using 3 main things:
  1. TfidfVectorizer: This convert text to feature vectors
  2. cosine_similarity: This helps to get the similarity score, which gives us the list of movies similar to an input movie
  3. difflib: This returns us the movies which are the closest matches to our input movie
